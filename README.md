# The-Punisher
Source Code for The-Punisher plugin
#### Archived, checkout https://github.com/54mpenguin/The-Punisher-v2 for more info

This plugin is my biggest and oldest plugin that I have had in production on and off for the past 3 or 4 years now.
Most of the code seems unfinished, uncommented and unrefined because I haven't been able to work on it 
for a good while and when I have I was unable to fix many bugs or finish features that I was working on.

This code is also behind by a couple versions and missing some unfinished classes as I didn't want to put the
code publicly on github until I was sure it worked and was ready for the public.

This code is not meant to be the most efficient by any means, it is just how I like to code my plugins 
and I am aware that I have some old pieces of code left in from when I had terrible coding habbits.
so that I understand and can read my code easier, that being said I do welcome constructive criticism.

The Punisher version 1.8-LEGACY is the latest stable version for 1.8-1.12.2 and will no longer have
new features added, only MAJOR bugs fixed. Future versions of the punisher will support 1.13+.
